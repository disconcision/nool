/*
paint plan:

this version only label nodes; does not replace them
we have a map from ids to (user-specified) attributes including paint color
paint colors come from a fixed palette which includes emojicon labels

flavor: Unflavored | {color: string, label: string}
palette: list(flavor)
attributes: {
  flavor,
  show = Overlay | Collapsed // overlay is color if flavored, collapsed is color + label or "..." if unflavored
}

model 1:
  model.paint = map(ids, attributes) 

view 1:
  for now implictly supress child Overlays, though retained Collapsed

actions 1:
  paintNode(id, flavor)
  showNode(id, show)
  unpaintAllOf(flavor)
  unpaintAll()
  
and then after that works, we can add a second painting abstraction, antipainting:
  add new flavor 'EscapePaint' (name needs work)
  this is only meaningful on decendents of a painted node
  and conceptually it creates a delimited multi-holed context
  simple use case: quasi-folding everything above a selected node
